# CS1550-Project-3
This project asked us to simulate virtual memory and four page replacement
algorithms: OPT, Random, NRU, and the Clock algorithm. To run the prorgram you need
to run it like so:

java vmsim â€“n <numframes> -a <opt|clock|nru|rand> [-r <refresh>] <tracefile>

I have included a trace file to test it with.
